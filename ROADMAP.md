## Phase 1.5: Architectural Improvements (Complete)

This phase focused on improving the underlying code structure to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### **Version 0.5: UI Refactoring**
-   [x] **Refactor UI into a dedicated scene (`UIScene`).**
-   [x] Establish event-based communication between game and UI scenes.
-   [x] **Optimize for Mobile:** The game is now fully responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   [ ] Add comprehensive tests for the UI scene and its events.

## Phase 2: Advanced Systems (Upcoming)

This phase will introduce more complex, long-term systems that give the game replayability and depth.

### **Version 1.0: The Career System & Interactive World**
-   [x] **Flesh out the Career System:**
    -   [x] Implement the logic for all core careers (Innovator, Scout, Healer, Artisan).
    -   [x] Create a visual in-game notification when a career is unlocked.
    -   [x] **Implement Career Mini-Games:** The 'Innovator' now has an engaging mini-game, making their career active rather than passive.
-   [x] **Enrich the Core Loop:**
    -   [x] Added an interactive home environment to provide more organic simulation and skill-building opportunities.

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Proposed)

With the core simulation and progression systems now in a stable and engaging state, future development could focus on expanding the world and adding long-term variety.

-   **Expand Career Mini-Games:** Design and implement unique mini-games for the Scout, Healer, and Artisan careers.
-   **Deeper Environmental Interaction:** Add more interactive objects to the home and create proactive behaviors where the pet uses them autonomously.
-   **Generational Goals:** Introduce long-term goals or challenges that can only be completed by specific lineages or pets with rare, inherited Legacy Traits.
