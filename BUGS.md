**Description:** In `updateDominantArchetype`, there is a syntax error where an `if` statement is incorrectly placed after `this.dominantArchetype = Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom(potentialDominantArchetypes);`. This misplaced `if` statement is also redundant, as the logic to handle the incumbent archetype is already covered. The result is that in a tie where the incumbent is not involved, the archetype is not correctly and deterministically updated, potentially causing unpredictable personality shifts.
**Fix:** The erroneous `if` statement and the non-deterministic call to `Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom` have been removed. The logic is now corrected to ensure that when a tie occurs and the incumbent archetype is not involved, the dominant archetype is reliably set to the first archetype in the `potentialDominantArchetypes` array. This makes the outcome predictable, fixes the logical flaw, and prevents flaky tests.
