# Best Practices

This document provides guidelines for developers to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Code Style

*   **Consistency is key:** Adhere to the existing code style.
*   **Keep it simple:** Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
*   **Don't repeat yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code. Use functions and classes to promote reusability.
*   **Comments:** Write meaningful comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.

## Documentation

*   **Document your code:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for all new features, functions, and classes.
*   **Update documentation:** When you make changes, ensure that the corresponding documentation is updated.

## Testing

*   **Write tests:** All new features should be accompanied by tests.
*   **Run tests:** Before submitting your changes, run all tests to ensure that you haven't introduced any regressions.
*   **Aim for high test coverage:** Strive to cover all code paths with tests.

## Code Reviews

*   **Be respectful:** Provide constructive and respectful feedback during code reviews.
*   **Be thorough:** Carefully review all changes to ensure they meet the project's standards.
