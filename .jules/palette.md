## 2025-12-07 - Soft Disable for Discoverability
**Learning:** Hiding features until they are unlocked (like "Work" or "Retire") reduces discoverability. Users don't know these features exist or what they need to do to unlock them.
**Action:** Use "Soft Disable" (dimmed but interactive) for locked actions. Provide clear feedback (toast + sound) explaining *why* it's locked and *how* to unlock it. This turns a frustrating "missing" feature into a clear goal.
