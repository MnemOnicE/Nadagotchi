## 2025-12-07 - Phaser Event Emission Frequency
**Learning:** `MainScene.update()` emits `EventKeys.UPDATE_STATS` every single frame. `UIScene` listens to this and, crucially, destroys and recreates all action buttons every time it receives the event (if on certain tabs). This created a massive, silent performance bottleneck where hundreds of Phaser GameObjects were being created and destroyed per second.
**Action:** Always check frequency of global event emitters in `update` loops. Throttling UI updates to 10Hz (100ms) is visually indistinguishable for stats but saves 80%+ of CPU time on the UI thread.
